# MINI ASSIGNMENT #1
1:GCC and it's option:-
-c
Compile or assemble the source files, but do not link.  The output is in the form of an object file for each source file.
-S
The output is in the form of an assembler code file for each non-assembler input file specified.
-E
The output is in the form of preprocessed source code, which is sent to the standard output.
-o file3
Place output in file named file3.

LLVM and it's option:-
-f
Enable binary output on terminals.
-o file3
Place output in file named file3.
-S
Write output in LLVM intermediate language (instead of bitcode).
-d
If specified, llvm-link prints a human-readable version of the output bitcode file to standard error.
-help
Print a summary of command line options.

2.GCC's front-end includes C (gcc), C++ (g++), Objective C, Fortran, Ada (GNAT), Go, and D .
LLVM's front-end includes the family of languages supported by GCC, Java, .NET, Python, Ruby, Scheme, Haskell, D.

3.LLVM is faster in compilation and occupies less memory as compared to GCC.
GCC is slightly good in execution time as compared to LLVM.

4.At -O0, Clang/LLVM was better than GCC.
At -O1, GCC was better than Clang/LLVM.
At -O2, Clang/LLVM was better than GCC.
At -O3, GCC was better than Clang/LLVM.
